    "Clustering algorithms are used in unsupervised machine learning to group similar data points together based on certain criteria. Here are some common types of clustering algorithms, each with its own approach and underlying assumptions:\n",

    "1. **K-Means Clustering:**\n",
    "   - **Approach:** Divides the data into k clusters by iteratively assigning each data point to the cluster whose mean (centroid) is closest.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions:** Assumes spherical clusters of similar sizes and works well with numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Clustering:**\n",
    "   - **Approach:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters by successively merging or splitting them based on a distance metric.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions:** No assumption about the shape or size of clusters, and it produces a tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**\n",
    "   - **Approach:** Forms clusters based on the density of data points, with higher density areas forming clusters and sparse areas considered as noise.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions:** Assumes that clusters are dense and well-separated by areas of lower point density.\n",

    "Here's how the K-means algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Choose the number of clusters, K.\n",
    "   - Randomly initialize K cluster centroids. These centroids represent the center of each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignment Step:**\n",
    "   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. The distance metric commonly used is the Euclidean distance.\n",

    "   \\[ \\text{where } \\mu_j \\text{ is the centroid of cluster } j. \\]\n",

    "4. **Repeat:**\n",
    "   - Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence. Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly or a specified number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, which is the sum of the squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid. Mathematically, the objective function is:\n",
